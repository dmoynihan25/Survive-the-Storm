# Survive the Storm
 You are a football player on the field after a massive upset. Make it to the endzone before your friend to survive the storming of the field. 

Use WASD to control Player 1, the blue person on the top
Use arrow keys to control Player 1, the blue person on the bottom

Colliding with a fan rushing the field halves your speed, which will return to normal after 2 seconds

Run through the Gatorade in the middle to increase your speed, and to quickly restore your lost speed.
